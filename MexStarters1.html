				    <li> Heat 1 tbsp oil in a non-stick pan, add the onions and cook for 10 mins over a medium heat. Stir in the rice and spices,tip in the tomatoes with a can of water and the tomato purée, then cover and simmer for 25 mins.Stir in the beans, take off the lid, bring back up to a simmer and cook<br> for 5-10 mins more until the rice is tender. Leave to cool.</li><br>

				    <li>Meanwhile, tip the flour into a small bowl.Mix the 2 tsp of oil with 115ml cold water,<br> then into the flour and stir with the blade of a cutlery knife until the mixture starts to come together into a soft dough.Use your hands to bring the mixture into a ball,<br> then quarter and cover with a tea towel while you wait for the rice to cook and cool.</li><br>

				    <li>Lightly flour the work surface and heat a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat, but don't add any oil.Roll out one of the balls of dough to a rough circle about 25cm that is paper-thin. Carefully peel off the work surface and slap into the frying pan.<br> The dough will cook within a minute, then flip over and cook for a few seconds more. Lift onto a plate and cook the remaining dough in the same way. Cover the wraps until you need them.</li><br>

				    <li>Roughly smash the avocados with the lime juice. Lay the whole lettuce leaves over the wraps, then add a layer of rice, scatter with sweetcorn, then top with the avocado, yogurt, coriander and olives. Carefully roll up into burritos.Wrap two of the burritos in baking parchment and<br> store in the fridge overnight. Will keep chilled for up to a day. If putting in a lunchbox, use an ice pack to keep them cool.</li>
