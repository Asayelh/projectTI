    <ol style="line-height:195%">
                <li>Mix the berries with three tablespoons of flour and fine sugar in a bowl and keep it aside</li>
                <li>We prepare the shelves of the first and third ovens in the oven while preheating the oven to a temperature of 180 degrees Celsius</li>
                <li>We mix the remaining flour, granulated sugar and cornmeal in an electric mixer, beating them well to make the texture like fine sand.</li>
                <li>Add the butter while continuing to beat, then put the egg yolk and water while continuing to beat to form a soft dough</li>
                <li>We add a tablespoon of water each time as needed, then we collect the dough in the form of balls and divide them into two equal parts</li>
                <li>We stretch each piece of dough into a disk and put them in the bowls</li>
                <li>Divide the berry filling between the two disks, leaving an indentation around the edges of each disk</li>
                <li>Sprinkle the remaining flour and sugar mixture over the berries</li>
                <li>Brush the dough with a mixture of egg whites, sprinkle it with sugar, and put it in the oven for half an hour</li>
                <li>We replace the pots in the oven racks and continue baking until the crust is red and bubbles rise over the filling and serve with ice cream.</li>
