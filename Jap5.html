			            <ul style="list-style-type:square; line-height:180%; text-align: left;">
				            <li>150g self-raising flour</li>
				            <li>½ tsp baking powder</li>
				            <li>2 tbsp golden caster sugar</li>
				            <li>2 eggs</li>
				            <li>1 tbsp rapeseed, sunflower or grapeseed oil</li>
				            <li>180ml milk</li>
				            <li>dash of vanilla extract</li>
				            <li>oil spray for cooking or a mild-flavoured cooking oil (whatever you use in the batter)</li>
				            <li>maple syrup, ice cream, crisp bacon, berries.</li>

				        <li>Sift the flour and baking powder into a bowl and add the sugar.<br> Make a well in
						the centre and add the eggs and oil. Stir them into the flour then gradually add the milk and use a
						whisk to beat the liquid in.<br> You can also put the lot in a blender and blitz it. 
						Stir in the vanilla. This batter is best used quickly.</li>

						<li>Put a non-stick pan over a low heat and put one or two non-stick crumpet rings (about 3.5 cm high) in the pan. <br>
						Spray (or brush) the pan lightly with oil and the inside of the rings too. <br>
						Fill them no more than ¾ full with batter then cover the pan with a lid and cook the pancakes for 
						about 10 mins on a very low heat.<br>
						By this time the top of the pancake should be covered in little bubbles and look dry around the edges.</li><br>
